# Panda3D-Multiplayer-Chat
This is a Client Server Networking framework I made for the Panda 3D game engine a long time ago. It's a good place to learn about how to do game networking, but needs many improvements. Also, I don't know if it will work with the most current version of Panda3D, pull-requests are welcome.

## Getting Started
To get Started you will need to run both the server and client.

Run the Server first.

    cd ./server
    ./run.bat
    
Now Change the IP of the server, in the client.
This change is in the code at ./client/main.py

Now Run the Client

    cd ./client
    ./run.bat
